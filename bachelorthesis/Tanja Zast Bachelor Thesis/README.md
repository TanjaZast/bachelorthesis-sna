# Classithesis OMI

This latex template is a modified form of the classicthesis template by *André Miede* and *Ivo Pletikosić*. You can find the original project under the following [link](https://www.miede.de/). 

The files stored in the Styles folder are for documentation purposes only and have no effect on the representation of the latex document. The respective formats can be selected via the configuration file and are part of the imported *classicthesis* Package. The configuration file also offers various customization options for individualizing the latex template. It is also recommended to define required packages within the configuration file. To change the style of the latex template, either existing settings can be overwritten or the import of the package *classicthesis* (line 147) can be substituted by a specially adapted version of the template. For the adaptation of the latex template using the TeXnixCenter editor, it is possible to use the project files provided by André Miede and Ivo Pletikosić. These can be found under the TeXnicCenter folder. By using the 2020 *pdfLaTeX* compiler it may happen that the references of the visualized acronyms do not match the reference style of the previous listings. If this is the case, it is recommended to switch to the 2019 version of the compiler.
